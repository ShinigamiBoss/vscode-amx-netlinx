This is a language package for programming AMX Netlinx control systems. It has syntax highlighting, a code beautifier, snippets for a lot of Netlinx
functions and code blocks, build tasks to compile your code, and shortcuts for the AMX programming help file, Netlinx Diagnostics, and the File Transfer utility. After installing the extension, please open your VSCode Settings (CTRL-Comma) and search for Netlinx and verify/update the locations in there.

## Note
This is a fork from the project of sentry07 https://github.com/sentry07/vscode-amx-netlinx that i made for extend the project with support for netlinx configuration file

## Use CTRL+SHIFT+B to compile your Netlinx code

## New in this release (0.7.0)
+ Adding configuration file support when compiling the Netlinx file (WIP)

## New in this release (0.6.0):
+ Added a document formatter provider. Use the context menu to select Format Document. You can also enable "Format on Save" in VSCode settings.
* (0.6.1) Changed AXI file extension to be Netlinx Source so it can be compiled as well.

## Known Issues
* Single line code blocks without {} brackets will not be detected by the code beautifier and will not be indented properly

## TODO
* Fix known issues
* Language server development

## Quality of life recommendations:
* Install "Open In Application" extension by Fabio Spampinato: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-open-in-application
* Install "Bracket Pair Colorizer 2" by CoenraadS: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2
* Use a different theme than the default themes for full syntax highlighting (One Dark Pro is amazing)
